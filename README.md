# Ethan J. Li

I am an efficient Shopify & WordPress Developer based in Montreal, Canada. I enjoy working on challenging projects and finishing work faster than I quoted.

I have a lot of experience in communicating technical ideas with non-technical people. I am good at spotting potential miscommunications between developers & non-developers. I tend to ask many questions before taking a job, such that I am on the same page with the clients in terms of what they want.

For my day job, I work as a C++ Software Developer on video games and game engines. I enjoy digging into complex systems and tackle difficult problems.
