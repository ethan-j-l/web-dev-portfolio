# Ethan J. Li

I am a freelance Full Stack WordPress Developer in my spare time. In the last 4 years I have worked with graphic designers and developed several WordPress based websites. 

I have a lot of experience in communicating technical ideas to non-technical people.

For my day job, I work as a C++ Software Developer on video games and game engines. I enjoy digging into complex systems and tackle difficult problems.
